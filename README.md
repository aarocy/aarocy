## 👋 Hello, I'm Aaron

I'm a creative technologist specializing in gesture-controlled interfaces, multimodal interaction, and accessible UI/UX. My work bridges technical rigor with design clarity, often framed as academic research with real-world impact.

### Project: Gesture-Controlled Music Player

A touchless, hand-tracked music player built with MediaPipe Hands and audio APIs, optimized for precision, polish, and accessibility.

- 🖐️ **Gesture Logic**: Robust recognition with adaptive thresholds and false-positive minimization
- 🎵 **Audio Integration**: Seamless playback and control via intuitive hand gestures
- 🧼 **UI/UX Design**: Monochrome interface with professional splash screen and smooth transitions
- 🧩 **Modular Architecture**: Extensible codebase for future multimodal input and analytics

### 🧠 Research Interests

- Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) and embodied interaction
- Accessibility-first design and error resilience
- Multimodal systems (gesture, voice, adaptive feedback)
- Evaluation frameworks and analytics for interaction design
